General requirements:
- implement the task as good as you can


Implement a Person class.

Person has following attributes:
- unique integer ID
- name
- surname
- sex M/F
- birth date 
You can get these information from the instance but you can not change them. (we do not consider ability to change name or sex)

Operations:
- Get person age in days.

Implement Mankind class, which works with Person instances.

General requirements:
- there can only exist a single instance of the class (Martians are not mankind...)
- allow to use the instance as array (use person IDs as array keys) and allow to loop through the instance via foreach

Required operations:
- Load people from the file (see below)
- Get the Person based on ID
- get the percentage of Men in Mankind



Loading people from the file:

Input file is in CSV format. Each person is in separate line. 
Each line contains ID of the person, name, surname, sex (M/F) and birth date in format dd.mm.yyyy.
Attributes are separated by semicolon (;) File is using UTF8 encoding. 
 
Example:
123;Michal;Walker;M;01.11.1962
3457;Pavla;Nowak;F;13.04.1887

Expected number of records in the file <= 1000.

Also suggest how to handle the situation when the file is much larger (100 MiB+) - in terms of this method and the Mankind class itself.
